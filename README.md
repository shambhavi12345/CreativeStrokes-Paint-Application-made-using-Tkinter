# CreativeStrokes-Paint-Application-made-using-Tkinter
This project includes the creation and implementation of a Tkinter GUI to be used as a drawing application called- “Creative Strokes” using suitable functions and widgets.



The following modules have been used in the implementation of this project:

1) tkinter: tkinter has been used to create the GUI for drawing including all
the colours, labels, canvas, etc.

2) Tkinter.tkk (Tk themed widgets): This module has been used to import
the Scale feature used for increasing or decreasing the side of the painting
brush.

3) PIL: The Python Image Library has been used to import the image
displayed as the icon of the window and extract the output file after the user
saves it.

4) Time: The in-built time module has been used to make the GUI window
resizable using ‘strftime’.
